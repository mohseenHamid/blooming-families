# Logo Upload

Place your primary SVG logo and optional PNG fallback in this folder.

Recommended filenames:
- logo.svg (primary)
- logo.png (optional fallback)

After uploading, I will wire the navbar to use `/logo/logo.svg`.

Notes:
- SVG is preferred for crisp rendering and small size.
- Keep visual padding consistent (export with minimal surrounding whitespace if possible).
- Target display size in nav: around 120â€“140px wide (we can adjust).
